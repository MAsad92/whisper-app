1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,160
President Pizzah, Mr. Vice President, Governor, Congressman Thomas, Senator Wiley and Congressman

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:20,559
Miller, Mr. Webb, Mr. Bell, scientists, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:26,839
I appreciate your president having made me an honorary visiting professor and I will assure

4
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:30,719
you that my first lecture will be a very brief.

5
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,200
I am delighted to be here and I'm particularly delighted to be here on this occasion.

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:44,000
We meet at a college noted for knowledge in a city noted for progress in a state noted

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,719
for strength and we stand in need of all three.

8
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,320
For we meet in an hour of change and challenge in a decade of hope and fear in an age of both

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,920
knowledge and ignorance.

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,560
The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,480
Despite the striking fact that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:18,319
alive and working today, despite the fact that this nation's own scientific manpower

13
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:26,039
is doubling every 12 years in a rate of growth more than three times that of our population

14
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:36,840
as a whole, despite that, the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished

15
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,600
still far outstrip our collective comprehension.

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:50,640
No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come now, but condense if you will

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:59,680
in the 50,000 years of man's recorded history in a time span of about a half a century.

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,920
Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first 40 years except at the end of

19
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,920
them, advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals to cover them.

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,759
Then about 10 years ago, under this standard, man emerged from his caves to construct other

21
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,959
kinds of shelter.

22
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,519
Only five years ago, man learned to write and use a cock with wheels.

23
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,359
Christianity began less than two years ago.

24
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:38,919
The printing press came this year and then less than two months ago during this whole 50

25
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:45,840
years span of human history, the steam engine provided a new source of power.

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,960
Newton explored the meaning of gravity.

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:56,800
Last month, electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available.

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,480
Only last week did we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power.

29
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,640
And now if America's new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus, we will have literally

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,759
reached the stars before midnight tonight.

31
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:22,879
This is a breathtaking pace and such a pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels

32
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,280
old.

33
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:32,159
New ignorance, new problems, new dangers, surely the opening vistas of space promise high

34
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,399
costs and hardships as well as high reward.

35
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,800
No, it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to

36
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,400
rest, to wait.

37
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,840
But this city of Houston, this state of Texas, this country of the United States was not built

38
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:06,360
by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them.

39
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:13,160
This country was conquered by those who moved forward and so will space.

40
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:21,480
William Bradford, speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony, said that all

41
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:28,040
great and honorable actions are accompanied with great difficulties and both must be

42
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,480
underpriced and overcome with an affordable courage.

43
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,560
If this capsule history of our progress teaches us anything, it is that man and his quest for

44
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,200
knowledge and progress is determined and cannot be deterred.

45
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:51,560
The exploration of space will go ahead whether we join in it or not and it is one of the

46
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:59,639
great adventures of all time and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations

47
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,280
can expect to stay behind in this race for space.

48
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,680
Those who came before us made certain that this country rolled the first waves of the

49
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,040
industrial revolution, the first waves of modern invention, and the first wave of nuclear

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,600
power and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space.

51
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,920
We mean to be a part of it. We mean to lead it.

52
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,720
For the eyes of the world now look into space to the moon and to the planets

53
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:55,520
beyond and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest

54
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,880
but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space

55
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,760
filled with weapons of mass destruction but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.

56
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:20,000
Yet the vows of this nation can only be fulfilled if we in this nation are first and therefore we

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,039
intend to be first.

58
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,599
In short, our leadership in science and industry, our hopes for peace and security,

59
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:42,640
our obligations to ourselves as well as others all require us to make this effort,

60
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,320
to solve these mysteries, to solve them for the good of all men and to become the world's

61
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:58,400
leading space-faring nation. We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to

62
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:06,239
be gained and new rights to be won and they must be won and used for the progress of all people.

63
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,679
For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own.

64
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:18,879
Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man.

65
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,199
And only if the United States occupies a position of preeminence.

66
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:35,759
Can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying dinner of war?

67
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:44,000
I do not say that we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space.

68
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,480
Any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea.

69
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:57,840
But I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war,

70
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,640
without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.

71
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,000
There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet.

72
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,360
It has a hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind.

73
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,480
And its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again.

74
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,160
But why some say the moon? Why choose this as our goal?

75
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,720
And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain?

76
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:43,360
Why 35 years ago fly the Atlantic? Why does rice play Texas? We choose to go to the moon.

77
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,000
We choose to go to the moon.

78
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,600
And we choose to go to the moon and do the other things.

79
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,759
Not because they are easy but because they are hard.

80
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:04,879
Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills.

81
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,879
Because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept.

82
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:14,879
One we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win and the others too.

83
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:29,759
It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space

84
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:36,399
from low to high gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my

85
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:43,439
incumbency in the office of the Presidency. In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being

86
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:48,639
created for the greatest and most complex exploration in man's history.

87
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,559
We have felt the ground shake and the air shatted by the testing of a Saturn,

88
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:02,000
C1 booster rocket. Many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glam.

89
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,480
Generating power equivalents to 10,000 automobiles with their accelerator on the floor.

90
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,000
We have seen the site where 5 F1 rocket engines, each one is powerful.

91
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:24,320
As all 8 engines of the Saturn combined will be clustered together to make the advanced Saturn

92
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:32,720
missile assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48 story structure

93
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:41,520
as wide as a city block and as long as two lengths of this field. Within these last 19 months

94
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,800
at least 45 satellites have circled the earth. Some 40 of them were made in the United States of

95
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:55,120
America and they were far more sophisticated and supplied far more knowledge to the people of the

96
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:07,599
world than those of the Soviet Union. The Mariner spacecraft, the Mariner spacecraft now

97
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:13,199
in its way to Venus is the most intricate instrument in the history of space science.

98
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,759
The accuracy of that shot is comparable to firing a missile from Cape Canaveral

99
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,879
and dropping it in this stadium between the 40 odd lines.

100
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,560
Transit satellites are helping our ships at sea to steer a safer course.

101
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,840
Tyre satellites have given us unprecedented warnings of hurricanes and storms and will do the same

102
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:42,720
for forest fires and icebergs. We have head off there yet but so about it even if they do not

103
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,560
admit them and they may be less public. To be sure.

104
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:59,519
To be sure we are behind and will be behind for some time in man flight but we do not intend to

105
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,759
stay behind and in this decade we shall make up and move ahead.

106
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:17,679
The growth of our science and education will be enriched by new knowledge of our universe and

107
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,319
environment. By new techniques of learning and mapping and observation.

108
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,480
By new tools and computers for industry, medicine and the home as well as the school.

109
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,399
Technical institutions such as Rice will reap the harvest of these games.

110
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,600
And finally the space effort itself while still in its infancy has already created a great

111
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:49,759
number of new companies and tens and thousands of new jobs. Space and related industries are generating

112
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:58,080
new demands and investment and skilled personnel and this city and this state and this region will

113
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,400
share greatly in this growth. What was once the furthest outpost on the old frontier of the west

114
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,040
will be the furthest outpost on the new frontier of science and space. Houston.

115
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:24,480
Your city of Houston with its manned spacecraft center will become the heart of a large scientific

116
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,560
and engineering community. During the next five years the National Aeronautic and Space

117
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,759
Administration expects to double the number of scientists and engineers in this area.

118
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,519
To increase its outlays for salaries and expenses to $60 million a year.

119
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,480
To invest some $200 million in plan and laboratory facilities.

120
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,560
And to direct our contract for new space efforts over $1 billion from this center in this city.

121
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,080
To be sure all
